**Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Hand-written Pattern Number Recognition System On FPGA**

The proposed project is to deploy hardware accelerator FPGA with its inherent parallelism and on-board memory resource to generate a hand-written pattern number recognition system. Computer vision employed in many accelerated applications currently usually requires a combination of electronic digital hardware and machine learning algorithm. Field programmable gate array (FPGA) has the advantages of lower power consumption and latency compared to other hardware such as CPUs [1], which makes it a perfect choice for an image processing unit. The simple neural network structure MLP could achieve the state-of-art performance with its generalization ability in the neural network research and usage on Intel (Altera) DE10-lite and preserve the process automation.
